	<!----- Q & A ----->


	<section class="head">

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a1">Which COVID-19 vaccines are licensed in India?</h2>

			<p id="p1">Two vaccines were granted emergency use authorization by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in India, Covishield® (AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin® (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). Sputnik - V has been granted EUA in the month of April 2021.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a2">What is Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)/ Permission for restricted use?</h2>

			<p id="p2">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a regulatory mechanism to allow the use of vaccines and medicines to prevent and/or reduce the impact of life-threatening diseases or conditions as caused by COVID-19. However, before grant of the EUA, rigorous assessments of laboratory and clinical trial data, including data on quality, safety, production of protective antibodies and efficacy is conducted. Safety is particularly critical aspect of this scrutiny and a risk-versus- benefit evaluation is done in the context of a public health emergency. Full licensure is obtained when the manufacturer submits the complete data. EUA by Indian regulators is aligned with global guidelines.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a3">Have the vaccines undergone the needed clinical trials before EUA?</h2>

			<p id="p3">Both the Indian COVID-19 vaccines have completed their Phase I & II trials. Covishield® has completed its Phase III trials in UK and the bridging trial in India.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a4">Why vaccination is not provided to children who are usual target?</h2>

			<p id="p4">COVID-19 affects all age groups; however, morbidity & mortality is several times higher in adults particularly in those above the age of 50 years. Children have either asymptomatic or mild infection. The general practice is to first evaluate any new vaccine in older population and then age reduction is done to assess the safety and effectiveness in paediatric population. The currently available vaccines have not been evaluated in children so far. There are some clinical trials now underway to test the effectiveness and safety of the COVID-19 vaccines in children.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a5">What technology has been used in development of the currently available two vaccines in India?</h2>

			<p id="p5">Covishield® vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, is a Viral Vector-based Technology which is also used to manufacture Ebola vaccine.<br><br>Covaxin® vaccine, manufactured by the Bharat Biotech, is a Whole-virion Inactivated Coronavirus Vaccine which is also used to manufacture vaccines like Influenza, Rabies and Hepatitis- A.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a6">Is COVISHIELD® same as the vaccine been given in UK by Astrazeneca?</h2>

			<p id="p6">Yes, Covishield® vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, is based on the same patent technology as the Astrazeneca vaccine.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a7">Developing a vaccine takes years. But this time our scientists have developed a vaccine against the novel coronavirus in such a short time. How was this possible?</h2>

			<p id="p7">Developing a vaccine generally involves years of research. First, we need a vaccine candidate that is evaluated in animals for its safety and efficacy. After a vaccine candidate passes a pre- clinical trial, it enters the clinical trial phase. While scientists have worked round the clock in the laboratory, even regulatory approvals which used to take several months have been fast tracked. It helped eliminate all the time lapses between the pre-clinical and clinical trial stages. Earlier, the vaccine development involved a series of steps, but in the case of the coronavirus vaccine, the scientists and regulators worked in tandem, accelerating the whole process without compromises on any protocols and any step.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a8">Do I have a choice of vaccine I will receive?</h2>

			<p id="p8">The vaccine will be supplied to various parts of India as per availability and distribution plan, beneficiaries load and so at present the option of choice of vaccine is not available.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a9">Is it mandatory to take the vaccine?</h2>

			<p id="p9">Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of COVID-19 vaccine for protecting oneself against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the close contacts including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a10">Will the vaccine be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of time?</h2>

			<p id="p10">Vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety and efficacy.</p>

		</div>
		

		<div class="a1">
			<h2 id="a11">Will the vaccine introduced in India be as effective as the ones introduced in other countries?</h2>

			<p id="p11">Yes, the COVID-19 vaccine introduced in India will be as effective as any vaccine developed by other countries. Various phases of vaccine trials are undertaken to ensure its safety and efficacy.</p>
